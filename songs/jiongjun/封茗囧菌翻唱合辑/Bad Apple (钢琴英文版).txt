[00:00.12]Bad Apple (钢琴英文版) - 封茗囧菌
[00:03.05]
[00:17.54]Ever on and on I continue circling
[00:21.79]With nothing but my pain in a paralyzing agony
[00:25.57]
[00:26.10]Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
[00:30.60]And suddenly I see that I can't break free I'm
[00:35.05]Maybe it's a dream maybe nothing else is real
[00:38.84]But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
[00:43.09]So I'm tired of all the pain all the misery inside
[00:47.56]And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night
[00:51.83]You can tell me what to say you can tell me where to go
[00:56.22]But I doubt that I would care and my heart would never know
[01:00.50]If I make another move there'll be no more turning back
[01:04.82]'Cause I throw it all away and it all would fade to black
