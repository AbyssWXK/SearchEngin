[00:00.01]词：简宁
[00:00.02]曲：欧丁玉
[00:00.05]
[00:24.28]个个要移民到处去寻寻寻
[00:28.08]你要到那远方
[00:30.76]觅心中梦想
[00:32.68]My home my home my my home my
[00:35.71]逃离繁荣闹市
[00:38.29]这东方天堂
[00:40.25]My home my home my my home my
[00:43.36]但愿日后醉倒
[00:45.95]玫瑰清幽花香
[00:49.04]Home my my home
[00:50.22]他朝不再有
[00:52.39]是烟花盛况
[00:55.53]My home my home my my home my
[00:58.48]遥遥无穷寻觅里
[01:01.14]是否找得心里梦乡
[01:04.92]
[01:05.68]让灵魂缠住了孤单
[01:08.79]飘于远方
[01:10.78]
[01:13.76]回头盈盈回望这
[01:16.40]万千灯火映照的海港
[01:20.24]
[01:21.03]像玫瑰千朵盛放
[01:25.94]My home my home my my home my
[01:29.12]
[01:44.18]你要到那远方
[01:46.90]觅心中梦想
[01:48.83]My home my home my my home my
[01:51.86]逃避繁荣闹市
[01:54.51]这东方天堂
[01:56.40]My home my home my my home my
[01:59.54]但愿日后醉倒
[02:02.17]玫瑰清幽花香
[02:04.73]
[02:05.26]Home my my home
[02:06.33]他朝不再有
[02:08.61]是烟花盛况
